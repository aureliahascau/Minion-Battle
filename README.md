# Minion-Battle
This is a project created using php and html, and it simulates a battle between a Minion and the evil called TIM. They all start the game with random generated properties. 
The game ends when one of the minions remains without health or the number of turns reaches 20. The application outputs the results each turn: what happened,the damage done, defenderâ€™s health left.
The winner is displayed on the screen.
